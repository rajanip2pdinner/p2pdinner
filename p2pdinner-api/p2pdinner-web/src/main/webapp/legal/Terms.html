P2PDinner reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that P2PDinner , in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or P2PDinner&#8217;s then-current Policies and Community Guidelines, or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are a Host, you understand and agree that P2PDinner does not act as an insurer or as your contracting agent. If a Guest requests a booking of your Dinner Listing and consumes your Dinner, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and P2PDinner is not a party to it. Notwithstanding the foregoing, P2PDinner Payments serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Host, payments from Guests of such amounts stipulated by the Host (including fees and/or Taxes).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Dinner Listing, such as requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Dinner Listing. Any Member wishing to book Dinner Listings included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. More information on how to set such requirements is available via the "Hosting" section of the Site, Application and Services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>P2PDinner recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Dinner Listings. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Dinner Listings carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests (and the individuals the Guest shares the Dinners, if applicable) when they consume your Dinner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>P2PDinner may offer Hosts the option of having photographers take photographs of their Dinner Listings. If you as a Host choose to have a photographer do this, the photographs taken will be made available to you to include in your Listing with a watermark or tag bearing the words "P2PDinner.com Verified Photo" or similar wording ("<strong>Verified Images</strong>"). You agree that you alone are responsible for ensuring that your Listing is accurately represented in the Verified Images. You alone are responsible for using the Verified Images and you warrant that you will cease to use the Verified Images or any other images if such images cease to accurately represent your Listing. All images, materials and content created by these photographers, including Verified Images, constitute P2PDinner Content, regardless of whether you include them in your Listing. You agree that P2PDinner may use the Verified Images for advertising, marketing, commercial and other business purposes in any media or platform, whether in relation to your Listing or otherwise, without further notice or compensation.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_no_endorsement">No Endorsement</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>P2PDinner does not endorse any Member or any Dinner Listing. You understand that Verified Images are intended only to indicate a photographic representation of the Dinner Listing at the time the photograph was taken. Verified Images are therefore not an endorsement by P2PDinner of any Member or any Dinner Listing. Members are required by these Terms to provide accurate information, and although P2PDinner may undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or endorse any Member or the Member&#8217;s purported identity or background.
Any references in the Site, Application or Services to a Member being "verified" or "connected" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification process, and does not represent anything else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by P2PDinner about any Member, including of the Member&#8217;s identity and whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Site, Application and Services. We therefore recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether to buy from a Host or to sell to a Guest, or to have any other interaction with any other Member. Except as provided in the P2PDinner Host Guarantee Terms and Conditions("P2PDinner Host Guarantee"), which is an agreement between P2PDinner and Hosts, we are not responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any legal remedy from P2PDinner with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any purchases or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by a Host against P2PDinner regarding the remittance of payments received from a Guest by P2PDinner on behalf of a Host, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled "Limitation of Liability".</p>

<p>These Terms and your use of the Services will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco County, San Francisco, California or a United States District Court, Northern District of California located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#8217;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution provision below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dispute_resolution">Dispute Resolution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You and P2PDinner agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Services or use of the Site or Application (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#8217;s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and P2PDinner are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and P2PDinner otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#8217;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</strong> The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Arbitration Process.</strong> A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA&#8217;s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</strong> Unless you and P2PDinner otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and P2PDinner submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Arbitrator&#8217;s Decision.</strong> The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator&#8217;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&#8217;s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&#8217;s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. P2PDinner will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Fees.</strong> Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, P2PDinner will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if P2PDinner changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated Date" above or in the date of P2PDinner&#8217;s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and P2PDinner in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
